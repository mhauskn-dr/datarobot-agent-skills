"""Layer 4 (regulatory): the org's live DataRobot risk-management policy
decides WHAT is required, and an LLM judges whether the repo satisfies it.

There is no gap-analysis-defined regulatory checklist. The policy named by
`regulatory.policy_name` is fetched from DataRobot risk-management, and every
mitigation it requires (union across its risk tiers, the strictest honest
reading for a repo that isn't deployed anywhere yet) is assessed against the
repo the same way Layer 2 assesses its conditions: the LLM reads the relevant
files (per-type `files_glob` in risk_management_mitigations.yaml) and judges
whether there is evidence the mitigation is implemented, or wired up to be
provided by DataRobot at deployment time. This is deliberately a
pre-deployment, "would this be compliant if we deployed it" check; it does not
inspect deployed entities.

Unsatisfied (or unverifiable) required mitigations become findings. Satisfying
almost all of them means adopting the corresponding DataRobot platform feature
(deployment monitoring, GenAI Guards, RBAC, Model Registry documentation,
...), not patching code in place. Findings are therefore advisory and
structural by default; the exception is mitigations satisfiable through
pulumi-datarobot (deployment settings, guards) on a repo that already carries
a Pulumi program, which become assisted IaC fixes and stop counting as
structural (see _finding_for_mitigation).

Degradation, the same "skipped-with-reason, never guess" philosophy as every
other layer: if DataRobot risk-management isn't reachable (no credentials,
feature not enabled for the org, no matching policy), Layer 4 finds nothing
and says why; if no LLM client is configured (--no-llm, or no model creds),
required mitigations are still fetched and reported, but as "required, not
assessed" rather than confirmed gaps.

The risk-management API is not yet publicly released as of this writing
(feature-gated, and there is no client for it in the public `datarobot` SDK,
checked directly against datarobot==3.18.0). This module calls it over
plain HTTP with stdlib urllib, no new dependency, following the standard
DataRobot Public API v2 convention of mounting under whatever
DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT already points at. Confirm paths against the live OpenAPI
spec once the feature is GA; a not-yet-public API carries no compatibility
guarantee.
